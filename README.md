# ARCH_News_Comments

This is a repository linked to the Archives Unleashed Cohort program: https://archivesunleashed.org/cohorts/  

The focus of this repository is to extract and analyse online comment from news websites derived from web archives.

The current code is based in [this notebook](Comment_Extraction.ipynb). Note this is still very much a work in progress.
